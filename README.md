# MastersThesis

This repository contains code and data used in the simulation and data analysis for my Master's Thesis on 'Treatment Effects in High-Dimensional Models: Analyzing the German Rental Brake'.

Two folders exist, that contain R-code from the simulation and the anaylsis of the data.
One file exists, that contains the results of the empirical analysis as well as the data set used.
Another file exists, that contains the results of the empirical analysis with a larger data set as well as the larger data set used.
The remaining files are results from the simulation study grouped by method. The notation of the results in the groups are, e.g. 'double1', 'rsplit2', etc., which indicates the method and the number of the corresponding parameter setting as denoted within my thesis.
